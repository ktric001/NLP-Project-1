# NLP Project 1
 This project is to test out Beautiful Soup, sentiment analysis, NLP processing, and data cleaning for a sentiment pipeline. The code takes selected tickers, cleans the data received from the scraped HTML links, and then produces a sentiment analysis using the Pegasus sentiment analysis model. This can then be exported to a .csv file for inspection.
